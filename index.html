    <h2>Why Your Personal Spending Analytics Is Important</h2>
    <h3>Crippling Debt</h3>
    <p>About 42% of consumers say they are worsening their financial situation by doing things like making impulse
        purchases and carrying more debt, according to the recent Real Financial Progress Index by BMO Harris Bank.Â 
    </p>

    <h3>Personal spending analytics is important for several reasons, including:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Budgeting and Financial Planning</b> By tracking your spending, you can identify where your money is
            going and
            make adjustments to your budget or financial plan as needed. This can help you save money, pay off debt, and
            achieve your financial goals.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Identifying Areas of Overspending</b> Personal spending analytics can help you identify areas where you
            may be
            overspending, such as eating out, entertainment, or shopping. Once you know where your money is going, you
            can make conscious decisions to cut back on expenses in those areas.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Improving Financial Literacy</b> Analyzing your spending habits can help you become more financially
            literate
            by understanding where your money is going, how you can make better financial decisions, and what areas of
            your spending can be improved.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Tracking Progress Towards Goals</b> By monitoring your spending over time, you can track your progress
            towards
            financial goals such as saving for a down payment on a house, paying off debt, or building an emergency
            fund.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Overall, personal spending analytics can help you make better financial decisions and take control of your
        finances,
        leading to increased financial stability and improved overall well-being.

    <h2>Use our Spendalyzer Application</h2>
    <h3>Using Naive Bayes Text Classifier to Classify Necessities and Non-Necessities</h3>
    <p> For the application, we used Naive Bayes text classifier to determine whether a
        given expense is a necessity or not based on the description of the transaction. The classifier is trained on a
        labeled dataset where each expense is categorized as a necessity or not. During training, the algorithm learns
        the conditional probabilities of each word or feature given the class label (necessity or not). When a new
        transaction is to be classified, the algorithm uses the Bayes theorem to calculate the probability of the
        transaction belonging to each class based on the presence of each feature in the description. The class with the
        highest probability is chosen as the predicted label. Naive Bayes is known for its simplicity, speed, and
        relatively high accuracy.</p>
    <h3>Researching Exponential Smoothing vs. Moving Average</h3>
    <p> For the application, we use both exponential smoothing and moving average forecasts to identify patterns and
        trends in the data. While both methods are useful for smoothing out fluctuations in a time series, they differ
        in how they weight historical data. Moving average is a simple and effective method for identifying trends and
        removing random fluctuations in the data. We use a fixed number of past data points, referred to as the "window
        size," to calculate the moving average. <br><br>

        However, moving average can lag behind the actual data and may not
        capture sudden changes or sharp turning points. Despite its limitations, moving average is easy to use and
        understand, making it a valuable tool for our application. Exponential smoothing, on the other hand, is a more
        complex method that assigns exponentially decreasing weights
        to past data points. This means that recent data points are given more weight than older data points, allowing
        the model to adjust more quickly to sudden changes or sharp turning points. This can be especially useful for
        our application in the current economic conditions where rising interest rates, inflation, and other economic
        factors can lead to sudden changes in spending patterns. Exponential smoothing can help us capture these changes
        more quickly and accurately, making it a better choice for our application in some cases.

    </p>
    <p>
        Exponential smoothing, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated method that gives more weight to recent data
        and less weight to older data. This is done by applying a smoothing factor or weight to each historical data
        point, with the weights declining exponentially as the data gets older. Exponential smoothing can be more
        accurate in predicting short-term trends and can react more quickly to changes in the data. It can also be
        adjusted to incorporate seasonality and trend changes. However, it requires more knowledge and experience to
        implement and tune the smoothing factor.
    </p>
    <p>
        In summary, moving average is a good choice for simple, straightforward time series data, while exponential
        smoothing is better for data with more complexity and volatility. The choice between these methods ultimately
        depends on the data and the specific goals of the analysis.
