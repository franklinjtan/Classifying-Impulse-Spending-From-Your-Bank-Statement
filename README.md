# Spendalyzer - A Bank Statement Analytics Application - WIP

## About
* An interactive web application that allows users to analyze their purchase history, understand their purchasing behavior, and receive recommendations based on scientific forecasts.<br>
* Featured functionality includes ability to read AMEX transaction descriptions and classify, using Naive Bayes whether a transaction is a necessity or not. Currently, users specify which categories are necessities.
* Used pandas, numpy, dash, nltk, and plotly libraries for data wrangling, data visualizations, web application framework, and ML algorithms.
* Next steps in no particular order would be to add new functionalities such as classifying expenses in a category using a ML Algorithm, reading in statement transaction from other banks (using Computer Vision), getting feedback from users, and hosting the site.
